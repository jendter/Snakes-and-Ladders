# Snakes-and-Ladders

An interactive snakes and ladders game, using the same probabilities as the actual board game!

Known behavior:
- It is possible to generate a snake and ladder that both begin on the same space. If this happens, the snake will be the one that "wins", and is used in play.
- While uncommon, it is possible to generate an initial list of where 2+ snakes, (or 2+ ladders) share the same starting point. If this happens, then the last generated snake/ladder is chosen for inclusion on the board.
